LVDS-1#1 Warning
Bidirection LVDS IOs  
The following port(s) use the LVDS I/O standard and have bi-directional differential usage. Please note that LVDS is a fixed impedance structure optimized to 100ohm differential. This is only intended to be used in point-to-point transmissions that do not have turn around timing requirements. If the intended usage is a bus structure, please use BLVDS/BLVDS_25, instead. ADC0_DA0_n, ADC0_DA0_p, ADC0_DA1_n, ADC0_DA1_p, ADC0_DB0_n, ADC0_DB0_p, ADC0_DB1_n, ADC0_DB1_p, ADC0_DC0_n, ADC0_DC0_p, ADC0_DC1_n, ADC0_DC1_p, ADC0_DD0_n, ADC0_DD0_p, ADC0_DD1_n (the first 15 of 78 listed).
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1852#1 Warning
BUFGCE_cascade_from_clock_buf  
Cascaded clock buffers exist in the design with constant CE pin. This may result in large clock skew and timing violations. Cell BUFGCE Ad9229Core_b64/U_serClk I pin is driven by another clock buffer serdes_clock_b64/inst/clkout1_buf.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1852#2 Warning
BUFGCE_cascade_from_clock_buf  
Cascaded clock buffers exist in the design with constant CE pin. This may result in large clock skew and timing violations. Cell BUFGCE Ad9229Core_b65/U_serClk I pin is driven by another clock buffer serdes_clock_b65/inst/clkout2_buf.
